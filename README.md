# Covid-19 Prediction for Malaysia

I. This project is for predict new covid-19 cases in Malaysia

II. The data is from GitHub - MoH-Malaysia/covid19-public: Official data on the COVID-19
epidemic in Malaysia. Powered by CPRC, CPRC Hospital System,
MKAK, and MySejahtera.

III. This data set contain missing value which is blank and Nans

IV. This project using LSTM, Dense, and Dropout layers.
